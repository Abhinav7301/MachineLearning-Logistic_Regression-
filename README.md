# Machine Learning - Logistic Regression

This repository contains implementations of logistic regression for various classification problems. Logistic regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for binary and multi-class classification tasks.

## Repository Contents

The repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **car_price_predictor.ipynb** - Logistic regression model for car price prediction
2. **diabetes_log_reg.ipynb** - Diabetes prediction using logistic regression
3. **logistic_reg_ex.ipynb** - General logistic regression examples and exercises
4. **Position_salaries_poly_reg.ipynb** - Polynomial regression applied to position salary data
5. **CarPrice_Assignment.csv** - Dataset for car price prediction
6. **Diabetes.csv** - Dataset for diabetes prediction
7. **Position_Salaries.csv** - Dataset for position salary analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visualization of results

## About Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. While it's called "regression", it's actually a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.
